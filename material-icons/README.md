# Material Icons Packaging

* Material Icons List: https://material.io/tools/icons/
* The Github repo is extremely outdated and doesn't include many icons found on the website.
* The webfont is being kept uptodate though: https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons

Use build.sh to create a new re-packaged material-icons tarball.

Past packages are now found here:
	https://github.com/tim-janik/assets/releases/tag/material-icons

Usage:

* Add to HTML head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/material-icons.css">`
* Use: `<i role="icon" aria-hidden="true" class="material-icons">local_cafe</i>`
