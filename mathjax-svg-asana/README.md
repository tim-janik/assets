# Stripped-MathJax

Releases of mathjax-svg-asana (https://github.com/tim-janik/assets/tree/master/mathjax-svg-asana) are based on the original MathJax, stripped of
a number of output renderers and fonts. The aim is to provide a small subset
of MathJax that is suitable for embedded HTML documentation without requiring
online access to assets like fonts.

Initial objectives:

- [ ] Keep the *compressed* size around or below 1MB to make embedding affordable.
- [ ] Support rendering from file:/// URLs.
- [ ] Support rendering with the Asana-Math font.
- [ ] Allow "Copy & Paste" for formulas.
